Uggedal's dotfiles
==================

This is an opinionated and minimalistic dotfiles repo. You will find no
superfluous shell aliases or obscure vim plugins here. The essential programs
I use in my daily workflow are:

* bash
* ssh
* git
* vim
* tmux
* weechat
* pass

In addition the following programs are used to form an ideal graphical
experience:

* herbstluftwm
* urxvt
* unclutter
* autocutsel

Installation
------------

I keep my whole home directory in git without using symlinking as often
found in other dotfile repos. Installation is therefore as simple as:

    cd ~
    git init
    git remote add origin https://github.com/uggedal/dotfiles.git
    git pull

Third-party dependencies are synchronized using a custom script
(since git submodules are a PITA):

    dotfiles sync

Uggedal's dotfiles
==================

These dotfiles are mainly used on Linux but should be usable on other
UNIX-like systems.

Third party dependencies are synchronized using a [custom script][dotfiles]
(since git submodules are a PITA):

    dotfiles sync

The following applications are configured using these dotfiles:

* vim
* zsh
* tmux
* git
* mercurial
* jshint
* xinit
* urxvt
* i3
* mplayer
* rtorrent
